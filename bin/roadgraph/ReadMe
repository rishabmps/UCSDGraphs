Class: MapGraph

Modifications made to MapGraph (what and why):
	1. AdList implementation of graph used as it is a sparse graph.
	2. addVertex,addEdge and other methods completed.
	3. bfsSearch and constructPath methods added while refracting bfs() method

Class name: Intersection
	Purpose and description of class:
		To store the roadType,roadName,length, endPoint Coordinates of the intersection.

Overall Design Justification (4-6 sentences):
	I preferred creating a new class Intersection as it made the code easy to reproduce and use. 
	HashMap is used to store the AdjList as one can perform reading from it O(1) {average}.
	Refracting was done to made code cleaner it also resulted in some helper(can be further used) methods like constructPath.
